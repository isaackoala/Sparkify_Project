# Sparkify_Project
This project focuses on the prediction of customer churn of Sparkify through EDA and ML. It was wrote on jupyter notebook and pyspark is the main package used. 

# Feature
The goal of this project is to determine the customer churn rate and the customer information features that have a major impact on customer churn through the analysis and evaluation of the existing 128MB data set, so as to provide guidance and reference for sparkify to develop response strategies. The project involves several tasks:            
1. Download Sparkify dataset.            
2. Explore the data set and determine the features related to customer churn.            
3. Aggregation and reorganization of relevant features.            
4. Design the model for classification and further optimization.            
5. Analyze the classification metrics and determine the main influence features.
